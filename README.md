# WalmartSalesAnalysis

## About

This project's primary objective is to delve into the Walmart Sales dataset, with the goal of gaining insights into the top-performing branches and products, understanding the sales trends across various product categories, and analyzing customer behavior. The ultimate aim is to identify opportunities for enhancing and optimizing sales strategies. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

"In this recruitment competition, participants are provided with historical sales data encompassing 45 Walmart stores situated in diverse regions. Each store is comprised of multiple departments, and participants are tasked with forecasting the sales for each department within each store. Adding complexity to the challenge, the dataset includes selected holiday markdown events, which are known to impact sales. However, predicting which departments are affected and the magnitude of their influence proves to be a challenging aspect of this task." - source
